# This file is automatically generated by Flutter.
# It is used to tell Flutter where the Flutter SDK is located.
# This file should be version controlled, but local.properties should not.
# 
# When running flutter commands, Flutter will generate a local.properties file
# with the correct flutter.sdk path for your system.
#
# Example content (will be auto-generated):
# sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/sdk
# flutter.sdk=/path/to/flutter
